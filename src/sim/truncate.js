/**
 * Rollouts cut short (Sami, 03/10). A rollout from turn 1 plays some thirty
 * moves to the end, the core choosing each: most of the tree's time. With
 * `trunc` (`ismcts+trunc=5`), a rollout stops once a border is won after at
 * least `trunc` moves — a new border each time, so a rollout that starts
 * past the first border runs to the next — and the core's odds of winning
 * the game stand for the result. Not once the pile is empty: from there the
 * end is short and exact.
 *
 * Rollouts settle borders at the end (`determinize` plays them at the final
 * rule, claims cost too much), so no border is ever claimed in one: a border
 * counts as won once both its sides hold three cards. Its winner is known
 * then, exactly: the better formation, or on a tie the side filled first
 * (`pickWinner`, settle.js).
 *
 * Shorter rollouts mean more iterations in the same time, so a cut engine is
 * dueled at equal time (`@tMS`).
