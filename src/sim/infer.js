/**
 * Guessing the opponent's hand (`ismcts+infer=N`, Sami, 04/10: a version at
 * 55 % against the V1). A plain search deals the cards it cannot see at random
 * (`determinize`): every hand is as likely, whatever the opponent just played.
 * Here, at the start of a search, N hands are drawn for the opponent and each
 * is weighed by how likely their moves were had they held it — the core's
 * scores turned into odds (a softmax at `temperature`). Every iteration then
 * deals one of those hands, in proportion to its weight, and the pile from the
 * rest.
 *
 * What is read: their last move alone (`infer` v1), or with `+memory=K` their
 * last K moves (v2, 05/10), which the bot remembers from one move to the next
 * (`createReader`). At an earlier move, their hand is taken as the guessed hand
 * plus every card they played since: the cards they drew since are counted as
 * already in hand, an approximation that grows with K. A move that claimed a
 * border is not read (the board it changed is not rebuilt), nor a first move.
