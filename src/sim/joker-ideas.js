 * Where to put a joker (Sami, 02/10, from `npm run jokers` on the kept
 * games). The `joker` habit (strategist.js) only lets one complete trips; these
 * ideas weigh where — the first bonuses a joker ever gets, since `ideasBonus`
 * only reads real cards.
 *
 * - `jokerFull`: facing a full side, the target is known — in the kept games
 *   its player wins the border 99 % of the time, the game 74 % (62 % for any
 *   joker). Earns `jokerFull`.
 * - `jokerWait`: facing a side still open costs `jokerWait` × the share of it
 *   still to come (a third per missing card).
 * - `jokerMid`: trips of 4 to 7 earn `jokerMid`: on mid-range trips a joker
 *   spares a suit the real card would have cut (Sami's reading; the games
 *   show 94 % of borders won against 91 % at the ends).
 * - `jokerRuns`: the habit also lets a joker complete a suited run.
