 * Looking ahead by playing the game out. The strategist judges a move by what
 * it does to one border; this bot takes the strategist's best few moves and,
 * for each, plays the rest of the game many times — the cards it cannot see
 * (the opponent's hand and the pile) dealt at random each time, both sides
 * then played by a fast policy bot — and keeps the move that wins most often.
 *
 * Every candidate is played out on the same deals (common random numbers),
 * so the comparison between candidates is not drowned in deal-to-deal noise.
 * The deals are seeded from the bot's seed and the turn: scoring the same
 * position twice gives the same answer, so a logged choice can be re-scored.
