/**
 * Sami's ideas on choosing a game (02/10): trips or suited runs, which the
 * cards cannot always give both of. Each judges a side of two or three cards,
 * once its shape is readable — a lone real card, with or without a joker,
 * could still become either.
 *
 * - `plan`: once a side of mine is complete, the shape most of my complete
 *   sides have is the plan; a side heading the same way earns `plan`, the
 *   other way costs it. Seven trips or seven runs come easier than a mix.
 * - `ends`: trips belong at the ends. Trips of 5 cut every suited run through
 *   5 (3-4-5, 4-5-6, 5-6-7) in three colours; trips of 1 or 10 cut one. A real
 *   card building trips costs `ends` × that share; a joker earns it — on
 *   mid-range trips it spares a colour the real card would have taken.
 * - `midRuns`: suited runs belong in the mid-range (4-5-6): `midRuns` at the
 *   centre of the values, as much again in cost at either end.
 * - `weakRuns`: a low suited run is overtaken by a higher one almost surely:
 *   it costs `weakRuns` × how low its top card sits.
