 * Sami's bait (02/10): low trips or a low suited run, started on a border that

 *
 * A border matters to me when it lies in my best run of three adjacent
 * borders (the highest summed odds, `chances`), and to the opponent when it
 * lies in theirs (the highest summed 1 − odds). Any other border is a bait
 * border; a card of 1 to 3 that starts or extends a low pair or a low suited
 * run there earns `bait`.
 *
 * Between bots the opponent reads odds, not intentions: whether it bites at
 * all is what `npm run duel -- core:bt2 core:exp` measures.
