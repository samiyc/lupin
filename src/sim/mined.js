/**
 * Rules mined from the kept bot games (`npm run rules`, 02/10): what winners
 * do more often than losers in the same game, turned into bonuses — only the
 * ones that are choices rather than luck (holding a joker) or the mere sign of
 * being ahead (playing next to a won border is mostly having won one).
 *
 * - `junk`: a side that is neither trips nor a suited run costs `junk` (losers
 *   build more of them: 59 % of their late moves against 41 %).
 * - `facing`: playing where the opponent's side is full — the target is known —
 *   earns `facing`.
 * - `underbid`: answering a lone card lower costs `underbid` (against the 0.9,
 *   losers do it on 25 % of their early moves, winners on 12 %).
 * - `nextToWon`: next to a border I have won earns `nextToWon`.
 * - `deepen`: while the opponent has started more borders than me, a second
 *   card on a border I have started earns `deepen` (unequal games: the winner
 *   does it in 80 % of such moves, the loser keeps opening with high cards).
