 * the strategist. Bonuses are in value units, like `STRATEGY`.
 *
 * - `counter`: answer the opponent's line on a border with the same shape one
 *   notch higher (5-6-7 against 4-5-6, 5-5-5 against 4-4-4); opening a border
 *   the opponent has not touched offers them that same answer, so it costs
 *   a little (`exposed`).
 * - `middle`: the three middle borders — the ones every run of three adjacent
 *   borders goes through — only open on a solid start: three of a kind held,
 *   or two suited cards in a row with both ends still unseen on the board.
 * - `edges`: a start that is not solid goes to the borders at the edges.
 * - `spread`: never open a value that already sits alone on another border:
 *   two lone 7s want the same cards, and one of them will miss its trips.
