 * (v1bj, e12open1: neutral), every weight of the 1.0's core (stfig6) moves at
 * once so that the oracle's move lands in the core's top 8 — the agreement
 * that ranked eight cores as their long duels did (0.93, data/oracle-bench.json).
 *
 * Each entry: where the weight lives in a core's settings (`strategy`,
 * `weights`, `params`), the size of one step, and for an idea the 1.0 does
 * not use, its name (it joins the core at 0, so step 0 is the 1.0 itself).
