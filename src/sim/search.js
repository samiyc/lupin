/**
 * A deeper look ahead than `lookahead.js`, for the experimental bot: more
 * candidates, and rollouts spent where they matter.
 *
 * The core shortlists `candidates` moves. Each step deals the unseen cards
 * once and plays that deal out after every candidate still in the race
 * (common random numbers, as in `lookahead.js`). Once every survivor has
 * `phase` rollouts, the worse half is dropped and `phase` doubles — successive
 * halving: most rollouts go to the two or three moves worth separating. The
 * search stops when its budget runs out, or as soon as one survivor leads
 * the other by more than `confidence` standard errors: an obvious move is
 * played fast.
 *
 * Pruning (`prune`, since 0.6): a border already lost for the mover
 * (`certainty.js`) gets one candidate at most — whatever lands there changes
 * nothing — and after every step a candidate whose best plausible rating is
 * below the leader's worst plausible one (`hopeless` standard errors) is
 * dropped at once, instead of waiting for the end of its halving round.
 *
 * A search is a plain object advanced by `step()`, so the page can run it
 * a little at a time — in a worker, and during the human's turn.
