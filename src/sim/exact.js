/**
 * The experimental bot's endgame (since 0.7): once the pile is empty and few
 * cards are left, nothing is hidden any more and the exact solver
 * (`endgame.js`) replaces the search. Up to 8 cards it answers in about
 * 0.1 s (`npm run bench`); at 10 it can take 20 s, more than the page allows.
 *
 * The root moves are tried in the core's order and the first win is kept, so
 * among several wins — or when every move loses, against an opponent who may
 * still slip — the bot plays the one its core prefers.
 *
 * `npm run pivots` (01/10): with the pile just empty, 12 cards in hand, the
 * solver finishes every position within 400 000 positions, 255 ms median and
 * 2.3 s for nine in ten. `nodes` caps a solve past the old 8 cards: one that
 * runs out returns null and the bot searches instead.
