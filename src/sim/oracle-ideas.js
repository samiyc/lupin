/**
 * Bonuses that push the core the way the oracle played (03/10,
 * data/oracle-diffs.json: on 2,300 gaps, the oracle's move against the core's
 * favourite). Not a proof that the oracle is right — the core-against-core
 * duels say whether the core gains by it.
 *
 * - `stay`: a card on a side already started earns `stay` (the oracle puts a
 *   2nd card 65 % of the time against 51 %, a 3rd 27 % against 17 %);
 * - `noAnswer`: answering — my side empty, the opponent's not — costs
 *   `noAnswer` (7 % against 30 %);
 * - `noBlindOpen`: opening an untouched border with nothing in hand to make it
 *   trips or a suited run costs `noBlindOpen` (4 % against 18 %).
 *
 * `stay` can be narrowed (each setting off when absent): `stayCard` 2 or 3,
 * only that card of the side; `stayFigure`, only while the side can still
 * become trips or a suited run; `stayUntil` / `stayFrom`, only up to or from
 * that turn; `stayBehind`, only while the opponent has started as many
 * borders as I have, or more.
 *
 * Two more from the oracle's whole games against the 1.0 (04/10), meant for
 * the start of a game (`earlyIdeas`):
 * - `noOpen`: any card on a border nobody has played on costs `noOpen`, a
 *   plan in hand or not (the oracle opens on 44 % of its early moves, the 1.0
 *   on 60 %);
 * - `noRun`: a card that makes a side a suited run costs `noRun` (18 % of the
 *   oracle's gaps against 46 % for the 1.0's core).
 *
 * The other two traits need no new code: sides with no figure (33 % against
 * 9 %) are `junk` with a negative weight, more jokers (14 % against 4 %) a
 * core without the `joker` habit.
