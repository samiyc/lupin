/**
 * Thinking during the opponent's turn, so that a human who thinks 30 s does
 * not then wait 10 s more.
 *
 * Guessing the human's exact move does not work: it names a card, and the bot
 * cannot tell which of some thirty unseen cards the human holds. But the bot's
 * own moves do not depend on the human's: its hand and its sides stay as they
 * are. So while the human thinks, the bot searches its reply averaged over
 * what the human might do — each step deals the human a hand from the cards
 * the bot cannot see, lets its core play the human's move, then plays out
 * every candidate reply on that deal.
 *
 * When the human has played, `take()` hands these statistics over as a
 * head start (`warm`) for the real search, at half weight — the real move
 * does change things — together with the time spent, of which the real
 * search is credited half (`CREDIT`).
