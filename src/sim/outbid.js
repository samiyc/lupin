/**
 * Two of Sami's ideas from his own games (02/10), on the first card of a
 * border — where `counter` (ideas.js), which compares shapes, says nothing:
 *
 * - `outbid`: on a border where the opponent has one card and I have none,
 *   answer it one notch higher (a 3 against a 2). If both sides end the same
 *   shape — two trips, two suited runs — the higher sum takes the border.
 *   With `outbidWide`, only while the opponent has started more borders than
 *   me: the moment Sami does it, filling his empty side of their open borders.
 * - `exposure`: opening a border nobody has touched with a v offers the
 *   opponent that same answer, a v + 1. It costs in proportion to the odds
 *   that they hold one now, read from the cards I have not seen.
