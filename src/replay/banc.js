/**
 * The similarity bench (`npm run banc`, Sami, 04/10): a version of the V1 is
 * judged in minutes, not by its win rate but by how close its moves come to
 * the oracle's, on a fixed set of positions the oracle searched twice
 * (`oracle/positions-banc.jsonl`, each with both searches' 12 most visited
 * moves: `npm run oracle -- --keep 12`).
 *
 * The main measure is a move's **oracle value**: the share of the oracle's
 * visits it got, over the share its favourite got (both searches added up).
 * 1 for the oracle's own move, close to 1 for a move it nearly chose, 0 for a
 * move outside its 12. Early in a game, where the oracle hesitates between
 * many moves that are worth about the same, a move it nearly chose costs
 * little — the noise of its early searches does not punish the version.
 *
 * Pure: the searches are scripts/lib/banc-worker.js's.
