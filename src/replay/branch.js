 * same deck, same pile, the same bots built again from the game's seed
 * (`seatRng`), so that the rest of the game repeats — or, with one change,
 * shows what that change does. No need to replay the start of the game.
 *
 * - `force: "random"`: the first move is a random legal move other than the
 *   one played — an error, to see what it costs; `force: { card, border }`:
 *   that move, to weigh it against another (the oracle, scripts/oracle.js);
 * - `engines`: other engines for one or both seats from that turn on — a new
 *   strategy tried on the same positions;
 * - `reseed`: the same bots with another seed — no change of play, only of
 *   the searches' luck: the control that tells a change from chaos, since
 *   early in a game any perturbation reshuffles what follows;
 * - `until`: stop after that many moves. Stopping at `TURNING_TURN`, once the
 *   pile is empty, and solving the rest exactly says who holds the game
 *   without playing it out.
