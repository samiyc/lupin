 * - `handClasses`: each seat's starting hand, weak, medium or strong;
 * - `columns`: the turn at which each seat had a card on all seven borders
 *   (null if never) — from then on no border of theirs starts from nothing;
 * - `firstBorder`: `{ seat, turn }`, the first border won and when;
 * - `advantage`: who holds the game once the pile is empty, after
 *   `TURNING_TURN` moves, by exact play.
 *
 * A turn is the number of moves played: turn T is the position after T moves,
