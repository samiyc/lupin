 * Two engines compared on the games they played against each other (`npm run

 * phase, and what its side of the board looks like at the end. Made to explain
 * a version's gain before it ships (why stfig wins) and to read the
 * attempts that did not.
 *
 * `readGame` reads one logged game from A's side; `summarize` pools them. The
 * pairs are the decks played from both seats: a pair's score carries none of
 * the deck's luck, which is what the paired interval rests on.
