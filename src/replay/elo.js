 * result at once — human games and bot duels together — so a player who only
 * met one bot is still placed against all of them. Pure; `npm run elo` and
 * the replay tab feed it.
 *
 * Every player also gets one virtual drawn game against the anchor, a light
 * pull towards it: without it a single won game would rate a player
 * infinitely high. Margins are 95 % intervals from the fit's curvature.
