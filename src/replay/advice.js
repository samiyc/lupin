/**
 * The Stratège's opinion on a human move, for the replay viewer (Sami, 03/10):
 * the line-up's Stratège (2.1, the core plus look-ahead) plays 16 endgames for
 * each of its 4 best moves, and for the move actually played too, on the same
 * deals — so the move played gets a share of games won that compares with
 * the Stratège's own. Too slow to run as a replay opens: the viewer asks a
 * worker (`web/app/advice-worker.js`).
 *
 * Returns `{ advice, adviceGap, refused, playedRate }`: the judged moves, best
 * first, their `gain` the share of endgames won; how much less the move
 * played won than the best; and whether the Stratège refuses that move at all
 * (a joker off a pair).
