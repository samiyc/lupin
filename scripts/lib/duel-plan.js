/**
 * How many games a duel plays, and when it may stop early. Pure, tested.
 *
 * A bot that looks ahead costs seconds a game where the core costs
 * milliseconds, so each profile has two scales. Games are played in rounds;
 * after each round the duel stops as soon as the result is clear — a
 * stricter 99 % interval while peeking, since looking several times would
 * otherwise flatter chance — at the latest after `max` games a seat, and in
 * any case once `seconds` have passed: the time budget holds whatever the
 * machine, and the interval printed says what that time bought.
 *
 * - `quick`: to sort ideas, 5 minutes at most;
 * - `screen`: to sort costlier ideas, 10 minutes at most;
 * - `long`: to decide a new version, 20 minutes at most.
 *
 * With `pairs`, the interval is the paired one (`pairedInterval`): each deck
 * is played from both seats, and a pair where each side wins once carries no
 * luck at all. Otherwise it is Wilson's, game by game.
